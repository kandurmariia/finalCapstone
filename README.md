# Task Manager

## Description

In this project, I used lists, dictionaries and functions to extend the functionality of a simple task management system. This is a program designed for a small business to help it to manage tasks assigned to each member of a team.

## Installation

Make sure you keep the task_manager.py , tasks.txt and user.txt in the same folder since this code assumes the presence of the user.txt and tasks.txt files in the same directory as the Python script. Also, make sure to run the program with a Python interpreter that supports the datetime module for accurate date calculations.


## Usage

Just follow the instructions on the screen an again, make sure to run the program with a Python interpreter that supports the datetime module for accurate date calculations. Once you choose to generate reports, two text files, called task_overview.txt and user_overview.txt are generated in the same folder.

## Credits
